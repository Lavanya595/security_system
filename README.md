# Automated Security Survilance System




This project, Automated Security Surveillance System, revolutionizes traditional security gate management by leveraging modern technologies such as face recognition and number plate scanning to decrease the manual work at the security gates of institutions.

Face Recognition: This employs facial recognition algorithms to accurately identify individuals approaching the gate.

Number Plate Scanning: The system captures images of vehicle number plates as they approach the gate. It records and stores vehicle information, enabling efficient monitoring and management of vehicles entering the security gate.

Automated Data Logging: It automatically logs details of recognized individuals and vehicle plates along with the date, time, owner details and vehicle model into an organized Excel sheet automatically, eliminating the need for manual data entry. This feature ensures accurate record-keeping and facilitates easy retrieval of access history for security analysis and auditing purposes.

Tech Stack & Dependencies or Modules Required :

Programming Language: Python,
Libraries Used:
opencv-python – for face and number plate recognition,
numpy – for matrix/image processing,
datetime – to timestamp all entries,
requests – for possible API integrations (future scope),
openpyxl – for Excel-based data storage.

The required modules will be automatically installed and the project will run if the 'securitysystem.bat' file is opened.

Future Enhancements:

*Integration with cloud databases for centralized monitoring.
*Live CCTV feed analysis with alert notifications (email/SMS).
*Mobile dashboard for remote access by security personnel.
*Improved deep learning models for higher recognition accuracy.

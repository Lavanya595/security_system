The count of images can be changed to some greater value and get more accurate results.

That can be altered in line 93 of ff.py (https://github.com/jvkousthub/securitysystem/blob/main/ff.py)

        if count>20:  
            break

The size of the yml file will be increased accordingly with the increase in no of images
